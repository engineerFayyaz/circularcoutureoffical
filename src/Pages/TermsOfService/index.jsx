          When you purchase any product, you will buy directly from the relevant Seller (not from us) through the circularcouture Platform and the contractual relationship in relation to the sale will be only between you and that Seller. We will not be a party to it. The relevant Seller will be responsible for the sale, the delivery (if applicable) and other after-sale care and our role is limited to acting as commercial agent to conclude the sale by collecting your payment via your chosen Payment Method on behalf of that Seller. Our receipt of full payment from you will discharge your debt to the relevant Seller in respect of your purchase. Though we may assist with certain practical issues on behalf of the relevant Seller, we do not have any contractual obligations to you and you do not have any contractual rights against us regarding any product sold on the circularcouture Platform by any Seller.
